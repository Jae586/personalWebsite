                <h2>Small Changes Big Results</h2>
                <p>The further that I get into computer programming and computer science as a whole I have to constantly re-learn topics that I "knew." It is a learning process but I still continue to revaluate and deeply understand the topics that I study. But at times my motivation to study falters.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This summer one of the things that I realized was that I didn't properly set myself up in an environment in which I can succeed. And so I began to focus on sleeping, cleaning and reorganizing, this also included buying a new monitor and stand-up desk. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Now with these small changes I have found it a lot easier to get my summer studying done. More sleep means more energy and a stand-up desk means that I can stand in a more energized postion rather than sit in an uncomfortable position.</p>
